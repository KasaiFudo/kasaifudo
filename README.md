## 🚀 Hi, I'm Matvey Katkov

Unity / C# developer focused on **gameplay systems, AI and experimental mechanics**.

I enjoy building small but complete projects where I can explore:
- physics-based interactions
- AI & simple neural networks
- algorithms and clean code architecture
- unconventional or playful game mechanics

I also run D&D streams, tabletop games and other games — which helps a lot with communication, improvisation, and teamwork.

## 🧩 Projects

- **[Mini Pinball](https://taimas-tavern.itch.io/mini-pinball)**  
  A modern reinterpretation of classic pinball mechanics.  
  → Physics tuning, scoring systems, moment-to-moment game feel  
  → [Repository](https://github.com/KasaiFudo/MiniPinball)

- **[Endless Terrain Map Generation](https://github.com/KasaiFudo/EndlessMapGeneration)**  
  Procedural infinite world generation built as a learning project.  
  → Chunk systems, noise-based generation, performance considerations

- **[Tower Defence](https://github.com/KasaiFudo/TowerDefence)**  
  Minimalistic tower defense prototype focused on clean architecture.  
  → Reusable systems, enemy waves, progression logic
