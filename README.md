## 🚀 Hi, I'm Matvey Katkov

Unity / C# developer focused on **gameplay systems, AI and experimental mechanics**.

I enjoy building small but complete projects where I can explore:
- physics-based interactions
- AI & simple neural networks
- algorithms and clean code architecture
- unconventional or playful game mechanics

I also run D&D streams, tabletop games and other games — which helps a lot with communication, improvisation, and teamwork.
